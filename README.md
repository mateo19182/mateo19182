# Hi there 👋, I'm Mateo: 

## About Me
I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in Machine Learning, particularly in Computer Vision. I'm also interested in [audio-visual](https://www.youtube.com/@mateo_19182/videos) programming and maintain a [blog](https://19182.bearblog.dev/) where I write about various other topics. I am finishing my Bachelor's Thesis at UDC on Implicit Neural Representations for Image Alignment. My favorite frameworks are PyTorch and OpenCV, but I also have experience with TensorFlow, Julia, and MATLAB. I'm fluent in Spanish and English and feel confortable in international contexts.
